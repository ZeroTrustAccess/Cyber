# Goals

## my current goals for my cyber adventure as of Feb. '24.

Work Remotely
Financially Support My Family
Work in Technology
I currently work as a technician for a well-known Fortune 500 company that is currently poised as the "Leading Essential Home Services Platform". Basically, Home Security + Smart Home.

I'm never home, and I'm constantly in customer's homes installing, troubleshooting, and fixing tech.

This leads to the Number One Priority of my entire career change:

-Work Remotely-

Cybersecurity and tech in general lead to many opportunities to work remotely, or from home. Family and Security are two of the most important things to me. Working remotely would allow me the opportunity to increase my productivity and efficiency. Cutting out travel time alone will allow me and my strong work ethic to be able to dedicate more time to security. It also lends well to incident response and SOC analyst work, which I find to be a great starting point.

-Financially Support My Family-

They used to say that there were only two certainties in life: Death, and Taxes.

My experience has been that people are scumbags. I wish they weren'tâ€”but they are. Because of this, there has always been and always will be crime and people who just want to do bad things. It's also tremendously obvious that our dependency on technology is not slowing down. In my 38 years, I've lived through the Before The Internet Era, watched it come up, all the way to present day. Seeing as though we are as dependent as ever on technology, it's a probable certainty that Cybersecurity is the third pillar in The Holy Trinity of Certainties in Life.

Talk about job security. That coupled with the fact that it's in high-demand, high-paying, and deals in all the things I have interest in...

-Work in Technology-

My whole life I've been the "computer guy", or the guy everyone took their phone to when they had an issue. I started my adventure with Coursera before I came across the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificte. I had first started about a year prior working my way through the Google It Support Professional Certificate. This was right when Google was ramping up its education material on Coursera. I made my way through half of the program, completing:

Technical Support Fundamentals (04/13/21)
The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking (05/05/21)
Operating Systems and You: Becoming a Power User (03/15/21)
Then Life happened and I realized the Help Desk was something I felt was already behind me in my journey. Troubleshooting and fixing people's computer issues is something I have been doing unpaid and unprofessionally for 20+ year.
