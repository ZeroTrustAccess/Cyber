The following information is of a classified nature, and what follows will be divulged according to **PoLP** -Principle of Least Privilege.

## .who
**ZeroTrustAccess** -not my real name.

## .what
This is where I will document my journey through learning about cybersecurity, and my transition from **beginner** to **not-so-beginner**. I'm ready to leave the desolate life behind of working in the *Withering Industrial Wasteland* and discard my "blue collar". Instead, I'm embracing my **binary roots**, and beginning my career in Tech--for a very deep and **personal reason**.

## .why
Wanted ta.

Lets begin.

### Genesis. Where I'm starting from.

While my tech.journey has been a lifelong endeavor, **officially** we could say my journey began with my taking the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** on Coursera. This introduced me to what cybersecurity was as a career, and it seemed to align with my goals. 

## .goals

-Work From Home
-Financially Support My Family
-Work in Technology


I currently work as a *technician* for a well-known Fortune 500 that is currently poised as the "Leading Essential Home Services Platform". Basically, Home Security + Smart Home.

I'm never home, I hate driving, and I'm constantly in customer's homes installing, troubleshooting, and fixing tech.

This leads to the **Number One Priority** of my entire career change:

-Work From Home

Cybersecurity and tech in general lead to many opportunities to work remotely, or from home. Family and Security are two of the most important things to me, and I spent too many years--making way too little money--away from my family doing things I hated. That will change.
