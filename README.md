# Hello_World

## Who
**ZeroTrustAccess** -not my real name.

## What
This is where I will document my journey through learning about cybersecurity, and my transition from **beginner** to **not-so-beginner**. I'm ready to leave the desolate life behind of working in the *Withering Industrial Wasteland* and discard my "blue collar". Instead, I'm embracing my **binary roots**, and beginning my career in Tech--for a very deep and **personal reason**.

## Why
Wanted ta.
